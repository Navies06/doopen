        <h3>
            Firstly I'm really sorry for getting irritated at you. 
            There isn't a moment that i can't stop thinking of you <br>
            I know it's really hard with the things you are dealing with right now.
            I'm frustrated with the fact that i'm unable to help you. <br>
            The distance is really hitting both of us really hard. I have been missing you very badly.
            <br> But trust me this distance isn't going to win. We swore to defeat it. <br>
            I PROMISE TO BE WITH YOU ALWAYS!!! now virtually in few years physically and through all tough times <br>
            You are something really amazing, a very hardworker, i just can't stop loving you. <br>
            You are one person who made me believe that real love exists among our generation. <br>
            You are everything to me. i'm nothing without you. <br>
            By this website i wanted to express few things. <br>
            First: I really love you ❤️ <br>
            Second: You mean the whole world to me ❤️🌍 <br>
            Third: There are many things which i can do only for you!!
            <br>
            This isn't end nor the beginning. The true beginning is once we start living together which is coming closer day by day <br>
            At the bottom of this i added few favourite pics of us which reminds me of you being in my arms just like the pics ❤️.
